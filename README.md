# Lahore Population and Environment Analysis (2016-2023)

This repository contains an analysis of the relationship between population growth and environmental changes in Lahore, Pakistan from 2016 to 2023. The study aims to understand how the rapid growth of Lahore's population has impacted the city's environment, including factors like air quality, water usage, waste management, and green space.

## Project Overview

Lahore, as one of Pakistan's largest cities, has witnessed significant urban growth over the last decade. This project explores key environmental indicators in relation to the population increase in Lahore, providing insights into the challenges faced by the city and suggesting possible solutions for sustainable urban development.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyze population growth in Lahore from 2016 to 2023.
- Study the impact of population increase on environmental factors such as air quality, water resources, and waste management.
- Visualize trends and correlations between population growth and environmental changes.
- Provide recommendations for policymakers to address environmental sustainability in the context of population growth.

## Data Sources

The data for this analysis was collected from various sources, including:
- Population data from government census reports (2016–2023).
- Environmental data (air quality, water usage, waste statistics) from local agencies.
- Satellite imagery and other geographic data.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages several data science and analysis tools, including:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and visualization
- GeoPandas for geographical data analysis

## Data Analysis Workflow

1. **Population Growth Analysis**: We explore Lahore’s population growth from 2016 to 2023, using census data and other demographic indicators.
2. **Environmental Impact Assessment**: We analyze various environmental factors such as:
   - Air quality measurements (e.g., particulate matter, CO2 levels)
   - Water usage statistics
   - Waste management data
   - Changes in green spaces and natural resources
3. **Visualization**: All findings are visualized using charts, graphs, and maps to better illustrate the relationships between population growth and environmental factors.
